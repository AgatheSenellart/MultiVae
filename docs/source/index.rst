*************************************
Welcome to MultiVae's documentation!
*************************************

This library implements some of the most common *Multimodal Variational Autoencoders* methods in a unifying framework for effective benchmarking and development. 
For easy benchmarking, we include ready-to-use datasets and metrics modules.
It integrates model monitoring with [Wandb](https://wandb.ai) and a quick way to save/load model from [HuggingFaceHub](https://huggingface.co/)ðŸ¤—.
To improve joint generation of multimodal samples, we also propose *samplers* to explore the latent space of your model.
